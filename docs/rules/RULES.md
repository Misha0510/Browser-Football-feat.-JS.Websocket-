# Rules

## Controls  

- `Mouse pointer` - point where your player is trying to reach.
- `Spase bar` - *hold mode*, slows you down, but you could hold the ball and automatically pull ball.
- `W` - power push that works on distance, it pushes ball in direction same as yours
- `A` - turns ball 90 degrees *left* relative your direction
- `D` - turns ball 90 degrees *right* relative your direction
- `Shift` - stops your player

### While in *hold mode*  

- `RMB` - **pass**
- `LMB` - **shoot** , power is much impressive than with **pass**, but you should get perfect timing by hitting <font color="green">green zone</font>
